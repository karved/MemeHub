# MemeHub
Web Development Project where the restrictions limited us to use only **HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, PHP**. Used [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) for styling.  
Clone this repo and create your own PHP connectivity database. You can then run it locally through remote db.  
We had it online through phpMyAdmin but the account expired.

### Basic Functionality

It was a Meme sharing website where:  
1. User had to create an **account**.  
2. User can then **view Memes** posted by all. (with category)
3. Can **Like and Dislike** the memes, whose count is visible to all users (multiple users supported).  
4. User can **Upload** the Meme according to the Category and see the **number** of Memes posted by the user itself.

## Future Scope

1. Add Comments section  
2. Sorting and displaying according to category.
3. Searching.
